# Hospitalised_queue_management
<h4>This project is a Hospital Queue Management System built in C. It helps hospital staff manage patients in the queue, prioritize treatment based on the severity of their condition, and record patient details.</h4>

<p>
  In this project, a **priority queue** is used to organize patients based on the severity of their condition. Each patient is assigned a **priority value** that is calculated using three factors: the severity of their disease, their waiting time, and the urgency of their case. Patients with a higher priority are treated first. The queue is sorted automatically so that patients in critical conditions are always at the top, ensuring that urgent cases are addressed as quickly as possible.
